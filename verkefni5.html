							<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>The fifth project of the semester, like the previous one, was part of a larger group project. Now, however, milling 
								a negative mold. Unfortunately, because of how the pandemic has escalated, a few weeks ago we recieved the sad news that the allotted 
								time for the project would not suffice and that there would inherently be some cut-backs. For this project we decided on something 
								we were all familiar with and easily executable, a LEGO block.</strong>
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							<p>
								<p>
									We decided to divide the project among ourselves so each of us only oversaw a part of it. My contribution to the project 
									involved designing the block. (The Lego block's toolpaths can be found <a href="https://joelinga.github.io/milling.html">here.</a>)
									During the course of this project I utilized only one program: Fusion 360.
								</p>
								<p>
									VCarve is a software solution for cutting parts on a CNC Router. It allows you to produce 2D patterns with profile,
									pocket, drill and inlay toolpaths.

							<p>The coding language used, as per the instructions, is HTML5, a language I was not 
								familar with until now. The choice was to either write your own website from scratch 
								or to modify and customize a preset template. I chose the latter. The creators of this template, 
								Prologue, are HTML5 UP (https://html5up.net), a free source of website templates written in HTML5. 
								Although I was not familiar with HTML, I am somewhat comprehensive in other programming languages 
								(Python, Java) so I did not feel like I had to particularly prepare myself for the modifying of a 
								preset template. Therefore, I just set up a GiHub repository, changed the URL to my liking 
								and began working.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							-->
							<p>
								In order to get the result I wanted, I oviously had to make some changes to the original 
								template. Some of these changes demanded new objects be created, such as the ones seen below, 
								the general structure for which I found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>:
							</p>
							<div class="feature">
								<div align="center;" class="social">
								  <img src="images/feature.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="180" />
								</div>
								<div align="center;" class="social">
								  <img src="images/social.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="180" />
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								This allowed me to align two or more pictures horizontally on the page.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another example is this: 
							</p>
							<a class="image featured">
								<img src="images/viewer.JPG" alt>
							</a>
							<p>
								This is allows me to present an interactive pdf document within the website, which 
								provided a very neat and useful solution in presenting my resume 
								(can be viewed under "About Me - Resume").
							</p>
							<p>
								A very handy feature in Visual Studio Code is the option through <i>Source Control</i>
								to track changes constantly and give them a title/comment, which can be pushed directly to your 
								GitHub repository after you have commited them. This feature makes it very easy to navigate your code's version 
								history.
							</p>
							<a class="featured">
								<img src="images/changes.JPG" height="240" width="500">
							</a>
							<p>
								I used this alot while working on the website and will definitely continue to do so in 
								future projects. 
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							<p style="font-size:20px">
								The entire code can be found on the website's repository
